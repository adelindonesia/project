    "The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of round-trip airline tickets from Lufthansa and Swiss airlines to Sao Paulo and New York City. By determining the optimal time to purchase tickets for each destination, it is hoped that significant savings can be achieved, allowing for the maximization of the travel budget. To accomplish this, historical data on ticket prices and other relevant factors such as holidays will be analyzed in order to identify patterns and trends that can be used to forecast future ticket prices. This project is expected to provide valuable experience in working with time series data and developing predictive models, while also uncovering practical ways to save money on air travel during peak travel times."

    "As students, we are constantly seeking opportunities to maximise our limited budgets.One area where we identified potential for cost savings is air travel, particularly during peak travel times such as holidays. During these periods, ticket prices can increase\n",
    "significantly, making it challenging for us to afford travel for visiting family or taking vacations.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we decided to undertake a project to develop a model capable of predicting the prices of round-trip tickets from Lufthansa and Swiss airlines to SÃ£o Paulo and New York City. By analysing historical data on ticket prices, we aim to identify patterns and trends that can assist us in forecasting future ticket prices. Utilising this information, our goal is to determine the optimal time to purchase a ticket for each destination, allowing us to save money and make the most of our travel budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, we hope to gain valuable experience in working with time series data and developing predictive models while also discovering practical ways to save money on air travel during peak travel times. By focusing on two specific airlines\n",
    "and destinations, we aim to develop a model that is both accurate and applicable to our travel needs.\n"

    "The objective of this study is to create a model that can predict the prices of round-trip tickets for Lufthansa and Swiss flights to Sao Paulo and NYC. The first hypothesis posits that historical ticket prices for these flights exhibit identifiable patterns and trends. By examining ticket price data over time, it is anticipated that these patterns can be discerned and used to forecast future prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate this hypothesis, historical ticket price data and other relevant factors will be analyzed to identify patterns and trends. This analysis will employ statistical methods to reveal relationships between ticket prices and other variables such as the time at which flight ticket data is collected. The second hypothesis proposes that the time at which flight ticket data is collected significantly impacts ticket prices. It is anticipated that collecting data at certain times during the week will result in lower ticket prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third hypothesis asserts that a model trained on historical data can accurately predict future ticket prices. To test these hypotheses, a predictive model will be created using machine learning techniques to forecast future ticket prices based on historical data. This model will consider a variety of factors known to affect ticket prices, including the time at which flight ticket data is collected and airline-specific factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research questions are: What are the primary factors that influence ticket prices for Lufthansa and Swiss flights to Sao Paulo and NYC? How does the time at which flight ticket data is collected impact ticket prices? When is the optimal time to collect flight ticket data to minimize cost? And how accurately can future ticket prices be predicted using a model trained on historical data?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that this project will yield valuable insights into the factors that influence ticket prices for these specific airlines and destinations. By creating a practical tool for predicting future ticket prices, it is hoped that travelers and students like us can make informed decisions about when to purchase tickets in order to minimize costs and maximize their travel budgets."
