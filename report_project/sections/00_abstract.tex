\section*{Abstract}
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of round-trip airline tickets from Lufthansa and Swiss airlines to SÃ£o Paulo and New York City. By determining the optimal time to purchase tickets for each destination, it is hoped that significant savings can be achieved, allowing for the maximisation of the travel budget. To accomplish this, historical data on ticket prices and other relevant factors such as holidays will be analysed in order to identify patterns and trends that can be used to forecast future ticket prices. This project is expected to provide valuable experience in working with time series data and developing predictive models, while also uncovering practical ways to save money on air travel during peak travel times.
