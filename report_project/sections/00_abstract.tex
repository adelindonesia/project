\section*{Abstract}
% The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the prices of round-trip airline tickets from Lufthansa and Swiss airlines to São Paulo and New York City. By determining the optimal time to purchase tickets for each destination, it is hoped that significant savings can be achieved, allowing for the maximisation of the travel budget. To accomplish this, historical data on ticket prices and other relevant will be analysed in order to identify patterns and trends that can be used to forecast future ticket prices. This project is expected to provide valuable experience in working with time series data and developing predictive models, while also uncovering practical ways to save money on air travel during peak travel times.
The goal of this project was to develop a model that could accurately predict the prices of round-trip airline tickets from Lufthansa and Swiss airlines to São Paulo and New York City.
By determining the optimal time to purchase tickets for each destination, we aimed to achieve significant savings and maximize the travel budget. To accomplish this, we analyzed historical data on ticket prices and other relevant factors to identify patterns and trends that could be used to forecast future ticket prices.
Our analysis revealed several key variables that influenced ticket prices, including the time at which flight ticket data is collected and airline-specific factors. Our predictive model, trained on historical data using linear regression, was found to have a reasonable level of predictive accuracy.
This project provided valuable experience in working with time series data and developing predictive models while also uncovering practical ways to save money on air travel.
